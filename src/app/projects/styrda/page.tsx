        At Stryda I have worked with two internal Admin projects that allow for
        easier way of working. Our first customer was the customer service,
        where I replaced depreciated dependencies, refactored and migrated the
        project from JavaScript to TypeScript. I also worked on tasks for new
        functionallity, mostly API CRUD operations. Our second stakeholder was
        the Business Intelligence team that are in charge of Stryda&apos;s core
        business and product. They went from manual to automated work, that is
        user friendly and less prone to errors that affect the business.
        Thorought my time at Stryda I have lead daily stand-ups, backlog
        refinements and sprint retros, created and scoped tickets.
