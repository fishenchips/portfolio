    `A solo project for my football team FC Krukan. A responsive RSVP app where players can register, and find the upcoming match schedule. 
    Players are able to attend matches if they can play, so the coach know who's available. 
    Future additions will be statistics from matches and training.`,
    `Data is stored in a MongoDB cluster, and the project is written in NextJs.`,
    `Note: You are welcome to try the app and create an account. I would appreciate it if you unattend any matches 
    you signed up for, before leaving the site. :-)`,
